// This is an example test file. Hardhat will run every *.js file in `test/`,

// `describe` is a Mocha function that allows you to organize your tests. It's
// not actually needed, but having your tests organized makes debugging them
// easier. All Mocha functions are available in the global scope.

// `describe` receives the name of a section of your test suite, and a callback.
// The callback must define the tests of that section. This callback can't be
// an async function.
describe("TestContract contract", function () {
  // Mocha has four functions that let you hook into the the test runner's
  // lifecycle. These are: `before`, `beforeEach`, `after`, `afterEach`.

  // They're very useful to setup the environment for tests, and to clean it
  // up after they run.

  // A common pattern is to declare some variables, and assign them in the
  // `before` and `beforeEach` callbacks.
